## Tradeoffs

Considering the small amount of information required for the client, I decided to manage state from within the main react component, BuzzBangBizz.tsx.

YARN install will download all the following dependencies:
(Create-react-app was used to set up the skeleton of the client code.)
• react, react-dom, react-scripts, react-router-dom
(Typescript is used)
• react-scripts-ts
• Bootstrap to utilize features for responsive design.
• Reactstrap to utilize common UI components designed for React.
